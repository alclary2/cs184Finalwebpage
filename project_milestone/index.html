<h1 align="middle">Final Project Milestone</h1>
<h2 align="middle">Title: Realistic Cloth Rendering For Project 4</h2>

<h2 align="middle">Struggles in Landing On Our Topic:</h2>
<p>Our team faced many struggles on settling on a final project topic. Our initial proposal was forking 
    and adding onto a NonEuclidean rendering engine. Unfortunately, it was written for Windows, and 3/4 of 
    the team has MacBooks. We spent 2-3 days trying to configure the base code in order for it to work, 
    but ended up deciding that the process was too time-consuming. We then changed our project idea to 
    realistically render textiles. To do so we determined we needed a ray-tracing program and landed on 
    Mitsuba. Unfortunately again, half the team wasn’t able to compile the program. We spent another day 
    screen-sharing to try and figure out why it wouldn’t build.Unable to find a solution we decided to 
    add onto an existing project. Knowing we needed a ray tracing program to implement a cloth BRDF we 
    decided to try and use project 3-2. We went to office hours to talk to the staff about implementation 
    and were told to trace the stack/compiler to figure out where in the code the specific BSDF functions 
    were called. We traced the stack and it always went into assembly language. So, unfortunately we were 
    not able to use the article to build on project 3-2 as hoped .Finally, Iman Kahssay found another 
    article, https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.html#materialsystem/clothmodel, that described 
    how cloth materials can be rendered using a shader program (like we did in Project 4). We then decided 
    to build on Project 4 via implementing a new local shading model that was tailored towards lighting for 
    cloth textures.
</p>
<p>In addition to the technical struggles, Lucy’s computer couldn’t turn on for 2 days and Iman contracted 
    a bacterial infection in her throat (i.e. strep throat). All 4 of us also had many other projects due 
    and other extracurriculars around the same time.
</p>


<h2 align="middle">What We Have Accomplished So Far...</h2>
<p>For our final project, we chose the concept of “Cloth Rendering” (with a difficulty level of 2.0), where 
    we will create a shading model that is fit for cloth materials, making them look more realistic (and 
    detailed) to the human eye. In the shading program, we will implement a local shading model (which is 
    based on perceptual observation, not physics) that focuses specifically on textiles. Similarly to 
    Blinn-Phong model, our shader utilizes the diffusion lighting, specular lighting, and ambient lighting 
    of an object. Additionally sheen color will be introduced in order to render two tone materials.
</p>
<p>In our code/implementation, we included the bump mapping - we modified the normal vectors of an object 
    - so that the fragment shader gives the illusion of detail (or texture) on the cloth. Once we added 
    the bump mapping into our implementation, we implemented the cloth diffusion BRDF formula (𝑓𝑑(𝑣,ℎ) = 
    𝑐𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 /𝜋) given to us in our research paper. We then chose to encode the “Charlie” sheen NDF (Normal 
    Distribution Function) into our specular lighting formula, and added the diffusion and specular 
    components to compose the local shading model for our cloth. 
    Next, we implemented the diffusion component, 𝑓𝑑(𝑣,ℎ) = (𝑐𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 / 𝜋) (1 − 𝐹(𝑣,ℎ)), given in our 
    cloth model research paper. We noticed that using this formula, our cloth looked lighter in color. 
    In the future, we will compare and contrast this formula with the Lambertian diffuse shading formula 
    and see which is better for our cloth shader.
    So far, the implementations we made have shown great results. There is, however, one bug that we 
    have not yet been able to correct. When the cloth is rendered, there are shimmering light pockets 
    in areas that are supposed to be dark, at the bottom of the sphere and cloth. We suspect the bug 
    is in the specular lighting component of our code, but have not been able to locate and fix the 
    issue yet.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Preliminary Results</h2>
<p>Before we implemented any code for our final project, we had the starter code from “Bump.frag” from 
    Project 4, where it shows the texture/detail of a cloth and uses the Blinn-Phong model. As you can see, 
    the cloth looks more plastic and unrealistic. After implementing our code, the cloth’s texture looks 
    more pronounced and detailed.  Also, the lighting implementation we used makes the cloth look more 
    realistic (and less like plastic). We did, however, notice that there is a bug in our specular 
    lighting, where there are shimmering light pockets in areas that are supposed to be dark, and at 
    the bottom of the sphere and cloth. We suspect the bug is in the specular lighting component of our 
    code, but have not been able to locate and fix the issue yet.

<h2 align="middle">Future Plan:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fix the specular lighting bug by <strong>May 3rd</strong></li>
    <li>Add anisotropic lighting component to our cloth shader by <strong>May 4th</strong></li>
    <li>Add and render more textures (such as velvet, silk, cotton, etc.) by <strong>May 5th</strong></li>
    <li>If we have extra time we will try and implment subsurface coloring as well</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>By May 5th</strong>, everything should be in order so that we are ready to show our project for the 
    Final Presentation.
